		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<h4>
			The main purpose of this blog is a way for me to document and share the intriguing research that I have done. I have had the opportunity to research in UC Berkeley EECS <a href="http://light.eecs.berkeley.edu/cch/">Professor Connie Chang-Hasnain</a>'s lab for the past two summers. In the summer of 2012, I participated in SHARP (Summer Highschool Apprenticeship Program), a month-long summer program that pairs up twelve high school juniors to graduate student mentors to work on research project. My research project was in the area of photonics. I optimized a specific vertical coupler (a device that enables light to enter a silicon chip) using Matlab and Lumerical. In the summer of 2013, I researched for a month again in Professor Chang-Hasnain's Lab. This time, I created a software that would integrate the different software needed to optimize a photonic device.
