		<h3>What is WiSE?</h3>
		<h4>
			<a href"http:="" www.ocf.berkeley.edu="" ~apoorva="" website="" "="">WiSE</a> (Women in Science and Engineering) is a theme program in the Foothill residential hall. It is targeted towards freshman girls who are majoring in the sciences and engineering. As there are so few girls in the STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math) fields, this theme program provides a way for girls to have a support system and study buddies for their technical classes. I found this program a great way for me to make friends with girls who are in my major and just friends in general.

		<h3>The Website and What I've Learned</h3>
		<h4>
			I have been familiar with HTML/CSS from a young age but have never been able to use this knowledge to help a club or organization. The WiSE website is the first project that I have had the opportunity of being the webmaster for. Thoughtout this process of making this website, I have learned a lot about website structure and ways to minimize unnecessary lines of code. For example, I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side Includes</a> (or SSI) which is a way to render other HTML files inside an HTML file. This is very useful when you have multiple pages and are using the same header and footer on every single page. Instead of having to copy/paste the header to all the pages, you can just include one line of code that takes the HTML from a different file. Two of my floormates are also helping with the website and we are all learning different web design techniques from each other.
